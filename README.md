## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a cloud developer building scalable, event-driven serverless applications using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. This project showcases how to architect cloud-native systems that are highly available, cost-efficient, and secureâ€”without managing traditional server infrastructure.

The foundation of this application is an event-driven architecture, where AWS Lambda functions act as lightweight, stateless compute units that respond to a variety of events. These include HTTP requests via API Gateway, file uploads to S3, message queues from SQS, and database changes in DynamoDB. This model allows the system to scale automatically with demand, improving resilience and reducing operational overhead.

API Gateway is used to expose RESTful endpoints, enabling frontend and third-party services to securely interact with backend logic. With support for request validation, throttling, CORS, and custom authorizers, it ensures secure and reliable communication between clients and Lambda functions. Integration with services like AWS Cognito adds robust identity and access control to the architecture.

This project also emphasizes cost-efficient workflows. By leveraging the pay-per-execution model of serverless computing, the application only incurs costs during actual usage. Coupled with efficient function design, modular event handlers, and asynchronous workflows (via Step Functions or EventBridge), the architecture remains both performant and economical.

Security best practices are baked in throughout. IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege, all data in transit is encrypted, and CloudWatch logs provide visibility into system behavior. Environment variables and secrets are securely managed using AWS Systems Manager or Secrets Manager.

This repository is a practical reference for developers building real-world serverless systems. Whether you're creating APIs, automating workflows, or designing event-driven microservices, this project demonstrates scalable and secure patterns for serverless development on AWS.
